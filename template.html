      <h3>Tu Luu</h3>
      <p> Hi everyone! My name is Tu, and I am a computer science student at City, University 
	  of London. I have always been interested in technological devices and had a curiosity as
	  to how TVs, computers and smartphones work. I have always used the internet and appreciate 
	  how we can use it to communicate with others. This prompted me to research technology 
	  further and start studying in detail. In the end, I decided to choose computer science.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Snake Game</h3>
    <p>
	I made snake game as my first project after 2 week Programming Bootcamp 
	at City (2021). On the first week, while I am doing my interaction exercises, 
	there is an exercises when you press a, d, s, w that make an object move 
	left, right, up, down, the first thing that my mind think is snake game. 
	This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use 
	of understandmore about Pvector, ArrayList and Classes. The main challenge that
	I struggled about was making the snake grow when it eats the foods, I had to tried
	many ways but the donâ€™t work, lucky that Mr. Charles (my tutor) helped me out, 
	and I also researched other snake game code as well to bring a way that i can use it.
	I am so proud that I can make it work as same as original version.
